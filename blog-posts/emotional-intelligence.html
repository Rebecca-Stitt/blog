            What is Emotional Intelligence?
          </h2></div>
<div>
          <p>Being able to perceive, evaluate and control emotions. Or understand, use, and manage emotions in a positive way.</p></div> 
          <div><p>It is feeling your emotion, clearly seeing how or what you are feeling, evaluating, and acting in a positive way/controling your emotions. It is understanding your own strengths and weaknesses and what your emotional triggers are - what makes you feel good or stressed or nervous. Recognising how your own emotions affect you and those around you, and then being able to control/self manage your emotions so that they do not negatively affect your actions. </p>
            <p>You are able to communicate, perform, interact with, or solve a challenge without your own emotions dictating your actions.</p></div>
          </p>
          <div><h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2></div>

          <div><p>IQ deals with intelligence/cognitive/brain ability. It is all really to do with the brain and learning, problem-solving, remembering, learning, and thinking abstractly. EQ is about emotions - recognizing them, controlling them, recognizing otherâ€™s emotions.</p></div>
          <div><h2>Why is it important?</h2></div>
          <div><p>Emotional intelligence helps us to recognize negative thought patterns, and behaviours and how you act on them. We can retrain ourselves to be less reactive to a negative experience, thought or feeling. We can retrain our brain to stop thinking negative emotions about ourselves. This benefits both our mental and physical health, but also benefits others. </p> </div>


            <div><p>We can learn to behave in a way that is separate from our emotions. That is - we can feel and recognize what emotion we have, but we can choose how we act or navigate a challenge. </p></div>
            
            <div><p>Instead of instantly reacting to an emotional experience, we can stop and explore our emotional state. We can identity what/how we are feeling. We can recognize this as an emotion, and proceed without it overly influencing our actions. Over time, we can identify thought or behaviour patterns, and choose how to positively modify them if necessary. </p></div>
            
            <div><p>Without being overwhelmed by an emotion (negative or positive), we can communicate better with others, as well as be more present and mindful when interacting with others. We can adapt to an environment or situation, and keep going. </p></div>
            
            <div><p>We can become more mindful of our choices. Feeling sad or stressed can lead to making bad emotional or physical choices.</p></div>
            <div><p> We may turn to unhealthy eating or drinking habits in times of emotional distress. EQ helps us to notice "hi, I am stressed. My brain is telling me to drink. I can feel the stress. Instead, I am going to go for a walk"</p></div>
          <div><p> When feeling anger because you experienced road rage on your drive home, you may take this anger out verbally on your partner at home. Instead, you can control this, by recognising you are feeling angry, meditating for 5 mins, and then choosing to interact with your partner in a much nicer way</p></div>
            <div><p>When dealing with stressful work moments, we can take a step back and reasses our stress levels. We can reframe what we can and can't do. We can decide to reframe our mindset, and choose to work in a calmer fashion, leading to less errors and as a better colleague to interact with.</p></div>
            <div><p> EQ helps our health, our relationships, and how we personally respond to emotions and situations or challenges. </p></div>
