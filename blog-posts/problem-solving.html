        "Hi, just me, Jar Jar, popping up on discord again, you got a minute or 10? I'm blocked?"
        </p>
     </div>   
    <div>
       <h2>Getting Blocked.</h2>
    </div>
<div>
     <p>
          Getting blocked, when writing code, is reaching a point where you have failed to solve a coding problem,
          tried again, tried different problem solving techniques, and reaching a point where you are unable to 
          progress/solve an issue. It sucks. 
     </p>
      
  <div>
        <p>
            In the real world, it would be like arriving in a foreign city at the train station,
            and trying to get to your Airbnb. You try walking there by following the instructions from your airbnb host - but they 
            are a bit vague. You can’t see any of the landmarks they suggested to follow, so you realise you are lost. In your head 
            you retrace your steps - but you can’t actually understand where you have gone wrong, or what to do differently. You re-read 
            the instructions...not helping... 
        </p>
  </div>
          
    <div>
        <p>
            You have a snack, a sit down, try to look up google maps. Again, doesn’t help. The provided maps 
            are not in a language you understand. You try to understand them anyway. But your location on your phone isn’t working so you 
            don’t even know where you are right now. You try walking in a slow direction to where you think you should be going but this is 
            just taking you backwards and you get even more confused. It’s starting to get dark. You have no idea of where you are, you have
            an idea of what your Airbnb bed will look like when you reach it and that’s all you want right now, but you have no idea how to get
            there. It sucks. You are absolutely lost, in a foreign city, and don’t speak the language fluently yet. You have no idea what to do.
       </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            You are blocked.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
       <p>
            I was so blocked in the beginning of a fairly simple question: create a function to give me the average of the test scores of a student. 
            It’s embarrassing for me to say how long it took. There were videos uploaded from lecturers that I watched to try to understand how to get
            to an answer - but I was still confused. I considered re-writing all my code I had done earlier, maybe that was the problem. It felt
            like my code was different or something. I went against that as the thought was too daunting. I’d already struggled with the code!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            I tried again. I felt under pressure and stressed. I was watching the clock and kind of judging myself. It was a question that should not 
            take that long a time - yet the minutes turned into hours. I attempted to read documents online. My head got lost. Understanding the language 
            and examples were like a challenge in itself.
        </p>
    </div>
     <div>
        <p>
            I took a step back. I went outside to spend time with the flat cats. I ate some food. I told the cats about the problem. It got me out of my head, 
            gave me a break, and made me think of going through notes from previous challenges. Dot notation and bracket notation. Getting information out of
            an object…Dot notation perhaps?? Go back to the developer mozillas. Objects. Bracket notation. Key value pairs. Parent objects. Imagining an object 
            as a box of things or book.I need to get my information out of this box. How do I do this? Using bracket notation from the object? How do I do this. 
            Go over the notes. Think of how examples provided could apply to your notes and goal. 
        </p>
    </div>     
    <div>
        <p>
            Throughout it I could feel myself getting more and more frustrated. It’s a slippery slope. I would get annoyed at various resources online. “WHY do you 
            have to use examples with x and y this is not helping meeeee”. I realise for me to grasp concepts, I almost need to visualise them. X and y does nothing 
            for me when I’m stressed. I need something to be like “box” or “animal1” “fluffyfur” etc otherwise my brain gets lost. I also need to take breaks or reach 
            out when really really blocked. It’s easy to think “I will just work for another 15 minutes and then I will get the answer” but often this leads to 20, 
            which leads to 30…and I would honestly feel exhausted and yet have reached no where. I would then just start working inefficiently and also go through 
            learning periods where it was in one ear out the other. 
          
    <div>
      <p> 
          Something I learned, and need to practise more is to remind myself not to compare myself against others at times. When I was stuck and blocked on a challenge, 
          and then would see on discord people also stuck but on challenges far advanced than where I was at, or when I was still on Gradebook and people were already 
          sharing blogs...I would struggle with self-doubt and comparing myself. I'd then forget about trying to problem shoot in a calm manner, and then fall into the 
          slippery slope mentioned earlier but on hyperdrive. It’s hard not to compare, and at times it can actually be motivating to keep striving. But it’s overall 
          pretty emotionally damaging and demotivating for now, so not really helpful at all. But it's something I’m slowly 
          getting better at. Even just reframing how you look at something can help I think. If I let myself be more inspired by someone, rather than feel bad about my 
          ability, it can be a motivator.
      </p>
    </div> 
    <div>
      <p>
          I think I was impressed when I solved the problem on fizz buzz for dividing by 3 or 5 using if else. At first I had a few ideas that just would not work.I don’t 
          have any idea how or when things like “---” or “--” made sense and became an instant thing I would type. But when writing my pseudocode, I was able to put it down 
          without thinking too much. The challenge itself was tricky. But by writing down my pseudocode, I was able to speak out what I wanted to do. I was able to talk those
          instructions to myself outloud/to my cat and reach little moments of “ooh research else if else again this is something I can do here”. Slowly go through the documents 
          and hints. Feel optimistic I could do it, and reorder my pseudocode to make the problem easier on myself.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Again I felt so challenged, and concerned at the time. Can I do this? But I tried not thinking about that and going with a bit of my gut. It may sound very simple and basic
         but that I remembered something like “---” or “!” which was new to me the week before without thinking about it, kind of gave me encouragement. Like something that at the 
         time I was first learning, had me staring at my computer, head cocked to the side being like “how…am I meant to remember this. I am doomed” somehow sunk in without me realising.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        I need to try to practise being more confident with this. It’s hard and I know I am slow, and it can feel embarrassing to not know an answer. But talking it out and writing pseudocode,
         having a break, practising self confidence, knowing that online you can look up notes and syntax to help, breaking a challenge down into smaller chunks, can really help.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h1> Reflecting on problem-solving techniques/processes</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Pseudocoding. </h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Yes please. Get the thoughts out of my scrambled brain, and put them in some kind of order. Break down what I want to do. Write how you might reach an answer. Pseudocode for now feels 
        safe. It’s not affecting the code, you won’t break the computer writing things down, if I want to I can always delete it (unless it’s important).

      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rubber ducky method.</h2>
      <p>
        Talking to the flatcat. Talking it out helps get out of my brain. Sometimes trying to explain to the cat what I want to do and why I want to do it helps give me moments of clarity. 
        Saying <em>why </em>I want to do something is actually pretty important for me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Googling</h2>
      <p>
        Google, my hero. No judgement from google. Completely anonymous. Just possibilities of getting an answer. UNTIL…you have difficulties deciphering language and syntax. Which again…you 
        can google. It gets easier the more you do it. So obvious now, but in the beginning I never thought to add “js” or “javascript” when trying to find an answer. Filtering through all 
        the information is also a skill, but something I’m getting better at. I quite like watching video results so I can actually see how/why something works. 

      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Trying something</h2>
      <p>
        It’s always a bit daunting and demoralising when you try and try and try and fail. It’s the only way to get better though and again, gets easier, and you learn from mistakes. Sometimes 
        I’ll be thinking “could this be the answer? No. That’s too obvious. I’ll see what happens though” and try it and it will work, and it will really surprise me. Other times the opposite,
        I’ll be kind of confident, and then fail and fail, but that’s when other methods of troubleshooting come in.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Console logging</h2>
      <p>
        Something I want and need to do more. So helpful! I can use it for so many more things than I realised. I want to keep practising as this really seems to help me. It keeps me on the right
         track. Also, for me personally, it helps explain how/why something may be. If I console log and get back an answer I wasn’t expecting, it gives me a moment to try and understand a 
         concept again. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Error messages</h2>
      <p>
        Love hate. Learning though to love them more. When they give the line where a mistake was made that’s easy to fix? Chef’s kiss. An error message in red that leads me to confusion…makes me slowly 
        read it again. Sometimes I have had to google an error message and that has helped. Sometimes I have wanted to scream at my computer asking “whhhhhhyyyyyy? I don’t understand what you are trying 
        to tell meeee”. But again, something that only gets better with practice. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Asking your peers for help. Asking your coaches for help.</h2>
      <p>
        So, so hard. So hard. For every other job, or every other discipline, that I’ve ever had,  it’s kind of been viewed as a weakness to ask for help. It feels like an admission that you are behind, or lacking, and it’s 
        hard not to think you are being judged for it. I find it embarrassing. It’s also hard when you’ve asked for help before to then ask again and again. At times I feel like I am the Jar Jar Binks 
        of my homegroup. A bit behind, clumbsy, always needing a bit of help.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Something I now like about asking for help is the process of how to get an answer, and the back and forth response of why something may or may not work. This weekend I really hit a block. My code would 
        not work. My ideas would not either. At one point I saw a video that literally gave the answer for something I was stuck with, but I really did not want to use it, as I still didn’t
         understand the actual concept of the answer given. I reached out for help to my classmate Brennan to help explain a concept, rather than giving me an answer. It was daunting but was also a really 
         positive way to learn. I shared my screen, explained what I was doing, and where I was blocked. I felt comfortable to make mistakes, give things a new go, and explain why I was doing something. 
         We were able to speak through a problem and problem solve when I would get stuck, and reach an answer without judgement, even though it took a long time for me to get there. I basically felt safe
         to make a mistake, and encouraged to keep trying and to look back at the mozilla pages, and see what I could do differently. It was a really positive way to learn. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
      <p>
        This is a regular practice but also hard to maintain. I feel like if I don’t have reminders to myself to do it before and after a task, the information or progress I have made can almost get lost a bit.
