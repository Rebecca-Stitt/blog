            <p>
              I think when I am unable to actually do something, or achieve something, I view it as a failure and I then 
              attach that act of failing, or at times even just the *feeling* of failing, as an identity of being a failure. I don’t
              think I’d properly realised that connection before  - that actions don’t equate to an absolute identity. That “failing” 
              at something, doesn’t actually mean that I am a failure. 
            </p>

          <div>
            <p>
               I find it embarrassing to not be able to do something, and that comes down to my own perception of what people are thinking
                of me. For myself, I view my personal achievements as an identifier or my own success as a person, but I would never ever think
                 that way of another person. It’s a bit of a reality check 1. Realising no one is really judging me as much as I think they are 
                 and.. 2. Most people are in their own heads judging themselves. My peers really don’t care as much as I previously thought they did about 
                  whether I’m good or not at something (unless it affects them in a way). It's actually a bit of a relief.

                I hadn’t really heard or understood neuroplasticity before, or growth mindset. Part of an ongoing change for the rest of the course 
                and my life is to reset how I think about myself while facing challenges, but also put into practise the ideas of growth mindset. 
                I.e tell myself “not yet” instead of “wrong. How are you not getting this…you dumbass” etc. Knowing that I can change my brain and 
                create pathways to learn code if I practise and keep going. But also the importance of trying and failing and viewing that as a 
                journey and success in itself. Effort counts, but only if you keep going with a plan and intent.

                I’d gotten the idea of emotional intelligence wrong my entire life. I thought it was just about being able to naturally 
                be friendly and like everyone. Literally never considered it to involve inner reflection or conscious actions. I had never thought too 
                much about both noticing and IDENTIFYING my thoughts, and then CHOOSING TO manage the way I handle inner thoughts and emotions. Does that 
                make sense? I had never considered the process of 1.noticing thoughts, 2. identifying thoughts, and then knowing I could both internally
                 and externally choose how to respond. That even letting myself think in a certain way after feeling a negative emotion, was a habit.
                 And that all of these responses, whether it was a mental habit or external reaction, really effects not just myself but those around me.

            <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
              <p>
                Values will be different for everyone and are personal. In programming you are likely to be working with multiple different people, and 
                from many different backgrounds. You may not know their values, they may not know yours. So it’s holding true to what you value as considerately 
                as possible, and also consciously giving space for people to hold their own values. Respect, compassion, equality, equity and fairness all come
                 into play when working with others and appreciating their and your own values. When working solo, it’s remaining true to your own values especially 
                 when times are challenging.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                When dealing with anyone in any setting, empathy helps you understand a person, and understand their actions more, with less judgement. You can’t 
                always decide who you work with, but you can use empathy to work in harmony with others. Empathy is hugely important in programming. Programming is hard.
                 People ask for help, people offer help, people struggle, people succeed. With empathy you can see where a person is coming from, and respond in a more
                 conscious, less reactive way. If someone feels inpatient with a co-coder, they may have good reason to be if the coder hasn’t been pulling their weight. 
                  In the same way, someone may feel anxious at working with another coworker who rolls their eyes each time they make a mistake...making them make even 
                  more mistakes, or prevent them reaching for help. Empathy allows both sides to stay calm and try to work better together, and ultimately produce better work.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                If you hold more empathy towards yourself, you may remain more level headed and calm. You may choose to admit you are struggling, know coding is hard, and 
                take a small break. When hitting a wall, you may be kind to yourself and ask for help. You will be less likely to waste yours and others time this way, 
                as opposed to spending valuable hours looking up something and failing, and reaching a dead end.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                The idea of empathy and values are pointless if not put into practise. If you are not self-aware of your actions, or your thoughts, you may not actually 
                demonstrate your values, or empathy, or kindness. You may hold various biases, sometimes without realising it or wanting to. Therefore it’s crucial to 
                keep present with thoughts and actions. You need to ensure your actions are professional, and your thoughts fair. You use self-awareness to choose how to
                 act and how not to act in appropriate settings and situations. Don’t brag about your flash new workstation around colleagues unless you know their living or f
                 inancial situation. Don’t get annoyed at someone who does not speak your dialect when they are not as fast as you want them to be at putting together a discord 
                 reply.. Encourage people from all walks of life if they are trying to code!

                So many aspects of it I wish I had been taught about in high school. I didn't realise EQ was a thing, I want my eq to be higher! Meditation is fairly new to me and I 
                can't believe how helpful it is. 
                It has helped in both the course but in my personal life. It’s so impacting on my life!  I deal with physical pains in some areas of my body, and I never would have thought 
                meditation could help, but it really can. Meditation helps me clear my head. I go to sleep with nightly meditation. I take time to breathe. I want to be more mindful of my
                 actions and thoughts. 
                I really am not as mindful as I thought.

                Dealing with some personal self-realisations when reflecting. Getting into healthy habits. Putting into practise what we had actually learnt i.e training yourself to change 
                thought patterns and behaviour. Easy and fascinating to read about, hard to put into practise and MAINTAIN that practise. A few new concepts that really took a while for me to 
                understand and research.

                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
              </h2>

                Bootcamp is intense. Foundations is intense. Work is intense. Life is intense. I think without being aware of your values, eq, thought patterns, and mindfulness etc it can 
                really have an impact on mental health, and performance. I struggled with foundations a lot, in every way. It was exhausting and hard and feels uncomfortable to fall on your 
                face and then fall and fall and then fall... But then you get a win! And you keep going. And then fall on your face again. I needed something to get out of my own head and brain 
                and shhh my thoughts, and reflection and meditation and looping with others really helped. Core helps you keep going. It helps set up daily rituals and habits to follow and keep 
                your mind clearer and with better intent.

                Bootcamp is going to be working with a large number of people, and at an intimidatingly higher level.  Everyone is at a different capability. Core values keep you mindful of your 
                own values while working with others. The values we have been focussing on focus on being empathetic, honest, kind, and trying your hardest and respecting others as well as yourself.

                In the tech world, it’s the same. With the tech skills you can be a great programmer, but when used alongside the core skills, you can be an outstanding programmer, and a person of 
                excellence and deal with challenges with resilience and be an empathetic and respectful team member. The way everyone should be! Truely. Some of the people I have met throughout the 
                course are really incredible and demonstrate the core values and teaching principles in every interaction, it’s genuinely really special.

                I think without the core side, I would be really too intimidated and scared of how peers may react to my skill level in bootcamp.t’s actually reassuring to know i’m not the only one 
                struggling, that there are different skill levels, and that empathy and kindness is taught so that I won’t be intimidated or scared or embarrassed at my lack of skills the entire time 
                and will feel okay to speak up and ask for help.

              No, it was great.I found myself at times going through some dark spirals during foundations. I had to remind myself to check in with myself and tell myself to stop, meditate, focus on working 
              on my eq. But honestly, when I needed it most - that was sometimes when I wouldn’t do it. I’d be failing to understand a concept or reach an answer, and would just try and try and try and then 
              exhaust myself and give myself anxiety. I’m still doing it. In my head, I would think “I don’t have time to stop. I don’t have time to reflect. I don’t have time to meditate. I’m so behind.” This 
              was so detrimental to my performance and mental state.  I really need to work on this in particular, but I'm getting there and glad we were taught to recognise it.

              I wish so much that I had learnt more of what was taught here in high school. There were some painful self-truths and realisations and reflections at times. But I don’t think I would have progressed 
              with the self-realisations without identifying them. I feel more confident going into bootcamp knowing that people have been working on the core skills also. I feel like if we work as a team and 
              use the core values in bootcamp, we will all become better programmers and workers and it will be a safe and effective learning environment.
