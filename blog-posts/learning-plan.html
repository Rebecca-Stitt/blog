<h2> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </h2>
</div>
<div>
  <p>
      I still have so so much to learn before getting a job in tech. 
      I will need to continue learning further with self learning online after the course, 
      both tech and core skills. The more I learn about the challenges of code, it makes me 
      want to eventually help people, and in particular beginners, learn to code. I think because 
      I understand how it feels to want to develop the skills, but struggle. So possibly at some 
      point help teach beginners, maybe high school children? Or in a community based setting. I would 
      like anyone from any background or age or circumstances to be able to learn the skills and know 
      they aren’t alone in struggling but also get there. There are some great resources out there, but 
      there should be more! 
  </p>
    <p>
      I would like to be able to one day work on creating websites or apps, preferably as front-end development. 
      I would really love to eventually work in a small collective to create websites or apps for smaller clients.

  <h2>Strengths and limitations in Bootcamp? </h2>
</div>
<div>
  <p>
     My strengths and limitations from my week 2 are fairly similar to what I have at the moment, but my limitations 
     are more extreme than I thought. I’m still slow at learning new material, and find it hard not to get lost in a 
     sea of information. I find it hard to know when to stop working for a bit, and when it’s smarter to give something 
     a break and then return to it.  My strengths I thought were pushing through, but it’s also a strength to know when 
     not to push through. 
  </p>
  <p>
     I really need to make sure I stop more before I get tired, so that I don’t spend time going backwards, or spending mine
     or other’s time rectifying needless mistakes I’ve made. I think it will be a challenge to talk in front of a group. It 
     will be hard as well to ensure focus for the entirety of the 9 weeks. I actually need to make sure to eat/sleep/and rest 
     better and make sure to do daily reflections and meditations. I’m also not good at sticking to time plans. This will be 
     something to work at in bootcamp further.
 </p> 

 <p>
     Strengthwise I do try my hardest and don’t really give up. But interestingly…in programming I think “giving up” is not necessarily
     a limitation. It’s kind of connected to getting blocked. Sometimes I need to be more honest with where I’m at and look at different 
     approaches or get the answer from google or elsewhere, or speak up when you aren’t getting anywhere. 
 </p>
 <p> I think I’m approachable and empathetic, which will be a strength in bootcamp.</p>
</div>

<div>
     <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2></div>
  <div>
    <p>
       I’d like to be more confident when talking in front of a group, or with a coding pair.  I’d like to have more confidence in general. 
       I get quite unsure of myself when I’m new to something, so often don’t speak up, or will just agree with someone else’s idea. I 
       don’t have experience at talking in front of a group and I’d like to be able to do it, but for now the thought terrifies me. I ’d like 
       to get better at communicating with people honestly - speaking up further when I am struggling, saying I need a break, that I still am 
       uncertain of a concept. I would like to stop comparing myself to others.
   </p>
   <p>
       I haven’t worked collaboratively in a creative setting with a team before, so would like to work in teams and share my work more, while also
       using other peoples input or code together. I'm used to doing my own creative work solo, and then presenting it to someone who says yes or not. 
       Working with others to come up with something together will be new to me and something I'd like to feel less anxious about it. Not being afraid 
       to show my work to others before it is finished or solved or working, and also not being afraid to suggest ideas to others, especially if I feel
       less technically able than them.
   </p>
   <p>
       I still have a very long way to go when it comes to putting my reflecting skills into practice so would like to work on that more. I really want to get 
       better at pacing myself and making sure when I need to stop and have a break, I do, and I speak up about that. I’ve gotten better at asking for help but
       I would like to continue this, and especially not just when I am completely blocked or in the panic-zone. I’d like to not have my stress or anxiety 
       affect others.
   </p>
  </div>
<div><h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2></div>
<div>
    <p> I think having people to ask for help with both tech things, and core related issues. Having people understand that learning a new skill and new languages 
        is really hard and stressful. For the bootcamp team to be patient, empathetic and kind. Being able to ask for help in person but also from behind a screen. 
        Knowing that asking for help in itself is hard and can be a bit embarrassing. Being encouraged by the team to keep going, even when students might be 
        frustrating with their attempts or mistakes made. Understanding some people are slower than others, and need more support than others.
</p></div>
<div><h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2></div>
<div>
  <p>
      I want to: speak up more when I am uncertain about something. Ask for further clarification from an instructor or student, whichever is less disruptive. In 
      lectures, not be afraid to ask a question. I will also use the regular techniques of looking up on google and also previous foundations work. When really 
      struggling, ask for facilitators to look at my work, maybe if they can go over material again to help me understand concepts or specific syntax better.
  </p>
</div>
<div><h2>Workload</h2></div>
<div>
  <p>
      Every day, every day, start with reflection and meditation. And end the night in the same way. Write down an action plan for the day and week. Keep a timer so 
      that I know when I am spending too long on a task, or too long away from a task. Know when to ask for help and do it. Know when to stop and do it. Have regular 
      goals. When finishing a task, reflect on what I learnt before just going onto other tasks. I need to make sure every day I sleep for 7-8 hours, get some exercise,
      drink water, and eat properly. Communicate with people and not go into hermit mode! Speak up when struggling before it gets to be a bigger issue. When entering 
      the panic zone or exhaustion zone just stop and don’t do anything to the computer, to the screen, to files, just stop.

    <h2>
      What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      To enter a field where I can earn enough to live comfortably with the opportunity to grow, and help people. I would like that to be in the tech field, but at the moment I am definitely already struggling with the course. Interestingly, perhaps, this makes me want to learn as much as I can during this course, and continue with my own learning after. And then, give very basic youtube videos for people who are also struggling.
    </p>
    <h2>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h2>
    <p>
      My limitations: it takes a while for me to grasp new ideas, and absorb them. I can get lost in small irrelevant concepts or ideas and then loose track of my focus. Limitations for me are also physical. I have suffered numerous injuries in the past 6 months, and am still experiencing constant chronic back and wrist pain. Although my gp, physio, and rheumatologist are trying to figure this all out with pain medications, tests, and physical therapy, it is another limitation that unexpectedly came up. When it gets very bad, to communicate with facilitators if I am struggling. 
    Strengths: I have perseverance, and genuinely try my hardest.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

    <p>
      Focused and pre-planned discipline. Without plans or accountability I loose track of time.
    Priorities to keeping track of time.
    Asking for help.
    Vulnerability. Letting people know if I am not able to do something and not feel so embarrassed or dumb for it.
    To be able to manage workload better. I would like to be a better communicator.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Demonstrate your commitments as to how you will manage your workload in this programme
    </h2>
    <p>
      Set alarms for work time when working from home.
    Set reminders for work periods when working with others.
    Follow the timeline guides TAKE NOTE of where I am struggling, so I can go back and refresh.
    Communicate with others where i am at. Ensure healthy habits. Sleep, eat better. Speak-up early when struggling rather than struggling alone. Ask for help.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How and where you will seek help in a timely way?
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I am struggling, head to discord chat and look for any answers. Ask my homegroup for help. Ask Jordan or Jared if really stuck. Speak up early, instead of spening too long on other youtube tutorials or websites trying to find an answer. Even if I feel like I am far behind everyone else, still ask, instead of being afraid to do so.

    </p>
    <h2>
      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team

    </p>
    <h2>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
    </h2>
    <p>
