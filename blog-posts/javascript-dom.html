    <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1> </div>
    
    <div> <h2>What is HTML, CSS and Javascript?</h2></div>
 <div><p>
HTML provides the content and the structure of a webpage. Titles, paragraphs, images etc.
</p></div>
<div><p>CSS adds the style to a webpage, and makes it look good. It changes the color of text, the size of an image etc.</p></div>
  <div><p>CSS needs HTML, otherwise there will be no content to make pretty/ugly for the webpage. </p></div>

  <div><p>Javascript allows interaction and magic to a webpage.</p></div>

<div><p>An analogy would be a birthday card.</p></div>
<div><p>We can think of HTML as the words on the front and the middle of the page i.e “Happy birthday” on the front cover with a birthday cake. Inside a message “Happy birthday to my most boring friend.”</p></div>
<div><p>The CSS would be selecting how it looks - the font, the layout, how big or small the image of the birthday cake on the front is.</p></div>
<div><p>Javascript is adding an action or interactive element to the birthday card. In this case, when the birthday card is opened, a photo of your boring friend asleep pops out, along with the song “happy birthday” played at half speed.</p></div>

<div><h2>What is control flow? Why does it relate to cake?</h2></div>
<div><p>Control flow is the order a computer will read, interpret and execute statements in a script. Typically, code is run in order from top to bottom, this is the flow. </p></div>
  <div><p>There are a few things which may change the control flow including conditionals, loops and functions.</p></div>
<div><p>Let’s have a look with a for loop</p></div>
<ol><li>You want to bake a microwave mug cake.</li>
  <li>Grab a bowl</li>
    <li>Put in 1 cup of flour</li>
    <li>Add 1 cup of milk</li>
    <li>Crack in 1 egg</li>
    <li>Add 1 tablespoon cocoa</li>
    <li>Put in a pinch of baking powder</li>
    <li>Whisk</li>
    <li>Add half a teaspoon of sugar and taste. …Is the cake sweet enough yet? </li>
<li>No? :Repeat step 9 until you reach the level of sweetness you want. It will probably be 2 teaspoons.Yes? Keep going</li>
<li>10. Put it in the microwave for 2 mins.</li> </ol>

<div><h2>What is the DOM? How can I interact with it? Will she be gentle?</h2></div>
<div><p>The DOM is the Document Object Model, it is a programming interface which allows programs to read and manipulate a page’s content.  It acts as a set of instructions for web browsers. 
</p></div>
<div><p> It can be represented hierarchically using a tree of nodes or elements by the browser. It all actually starts with the window - the matriarch of our family. The window is not actually a ‘true’ element of the DOM, so she is not listed on the diagram. It is more your web browser. But just know that she is there, above us all.</p></div> <div><p>Underneath her, is Document. This is the representation of a webpage. Below her we have our root element - our html. Next, the family starts having more children - we have two child elements - a head and a body. They have their own children, and then their children have their own children…and so on. </p></div><div><p>…Something to remember though is that there can only ever be one parent of a child element. It’s a good thing. This helps us find specific elements easier.</p></div>
<div><p>Say we had an html button with an id attribute of hotStuff. We could use Javascript to find this hotStuff button on our document (our webpage), and modify it, perhaps make it a smoking red color each time it is clicked using an event listener. Maybe at some point a capable programmer could make the pressing of the button play the chorus of Donna Summer’s 1979 smash hit “Hot Suff” for an unsuspecting webpage user.
</p></div>

<div><h2>Objects? Arrays? Explain the difference between accessing data from each. </h2></div>
<div><p>We can use both objects and arrays to store data, but they are useful for different data types.
 </p></div>
 <div><p>A javascript object is a collection of data. It has a list of properties, each with a name(key), which has assigned to it a value</p></div>
<div><p>A dictionary is a good metaphor here. An object is a dictionary. It has a number of names of words(referred to as keys), and the definition of the word (meaning the value). The pair is known as the key-value pair (or…the word-definition pair)</p></div>
<div><p>Here is an example of a javascript object. <p/>
<p>let hotStuff = { </p>
<p>firstName: ‘Donna’,</p>
<p>lastName: ‘Summer”, </p>
<p>favouriteSeason: ‘Winter’,</p>
<div><p>To access the data, you want to use dot notation or bracket notation. We can use dot notation to pull out hotStuff.firstName to give us Donna.</p></div>
<div><p> Arrays on the other hand: Are a list of things. You can enter multiple items inside one variable. The list is indexed - every item in the list in an array has an index number, and we can then call an item from the array list, by calling a number. AN INTERESTING AND CONFUSING THING TO NOTE is that in programming, arrays start at zero. So when counting, we count 0,1,2,4 etc. </p></div>
<br><p>We have a list concerning song titles of Donna Summer</p>
<p>Iet donnaSummer = </body>p>
  <p>[‘hot stuff’, ‘bad girl’ ‘feels love’]; </p>
<p>to get a piece of data, we would type donnaSummer[0] to get ‘ hot stuff’ donnaSummer[1] to get ‘bad girl’ and donnaSummer[3] to get ‘feels love’.
</p>
<div><h2>What are functions? Why are they helpful?</h2></div>
<div><p>Functions help us to perform various tasks. They also help us to at times perform multiple tasks without us repeating ourselves. 
We always need to first define a function --Function nameoffunction--. Explain what the function actually does. And then call the function. nameoffunction. Defining and calling a function are very different. Until you call a function, nothing is going to happen. It’s like writing a list, but until you say “hey let’s make this list happen! :D”... nothing will happen. D:
