        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
            <p>
              Neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to learn, rewire, and develop new 
              neurons and neuron pathways. With time, dedication, practise and intent with our 
              learning,, new neurons and skills can be developed. The brain can adapt and rewire itself! 
              We can both learn and flourish new skills, knowledge, habits and talents. 
              This can benefit us in many ways. For learning a new knowledge set, learning with dedicated 
              practise and intent can help us learn faster and with a stronger understanding. Even the act of 
              imagining practising our new skillset benefits us.
             </p>
             <p>
              Neuroplasticity can even help in a physical manner. For patients with limited movement, they can imagine a 
              part of their body moving, going through rehabilitation exercises. Just the practise alone of imagining has 
              shown to actually increase the muscle strength and development.
            </p>

              For negative thought patterns, we can re-train our brain to think otherwise. When you start changing your thoughts
               habitually, you change your emotions. When you change your thoughts and emotions, you change your behaviour. When 
               you change your behaviour, you can also change your performance - André Vermeulen from his talk on Neuroplasticy <a href="https://youtu.be/Jq0n8vgggU0">here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of saying “I can’t, I can’t do anything, I’m a failure” and feeling depressed, defeated and awful…You can try 
              to change your thought process to eliminate such negative self-talk. You can choose to be kinder and think of yourself 
              in a supportive way, thinking “I can try. I can do this. I have other skills too that I struggled with at first, 
              I’m not a failure”. 
              </p>
                <h2>Mental practise, and imagination</h2>
                    <p>
                      A person’s brain and their intelligence was once thought of as finite and static in terms of their learning potential.
                       That if you were born smart, you were smart. If you were born not so smart, that’s just how your brain was and would 
                       remain. It has since been discovered that the brain is malleable and can grow. You are not restricted in your
                        intelligence, skillset, or abilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Anyone can improve or learn. For student’s who are challenged in a particular field, they can actually flourish in it with
                       practise - they are not destined to be stuck feeling lost or behind forever. If the brain is looked at like a muscle, it 
                       can grow and expand. More neurons and connections can be created - new skillset super highways can be constructed.. Instead
                       of feeling like a failure on a failed first, 3rd, 5th attempt, try applying the “not yet” mind set. That not understanding 
                       something straight away is okay. You can get there, you just aren’t there yet. It is important to not just celebrate final
                      success - but of the journey getting there. For striving, for trying, for progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I was literally shocked when I discovered the brain is able improve physical abilities by <em>imagining</em> working out a 
                      muscle or movement in the brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I will try to not get frustrated or annoyed or speak down on myself for not getting something as quickly as others. I will 
                      commit to a “not yet” mind set and keep trying even if I feel not capable of something, and try to not let my own inner critic 
                      take over or overwhelm.
